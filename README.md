# Generative-Pre-trained-Transformers
This is the project that covers the use of transformers and prompt engineering for NLP Tasks. This project is done in collaboration with Packt.

This is my publication Unleashing the Power of AI with OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3. For the complete implementation head over to the link to review the publication.

Collaboration: Packt Courses

  - Created a project for testing the working of the OpenAI API on different platforms. Worked on prompt engineering for generating effective responses from transformers. Tested the OpenAI Playground by sending API requests by carefully setting the OpenAI parameters.
  - Concepts covered: history of generative pre-trained transformers, sequence-to-sequence architecture of transformers, attention mechanisms in transformers, large language models LLM, prompt engineering, Named-Entity Recognition NER, tokenization, embeddings, and accessing OpenAI services through its API. 

Platform: Visual Studio Code, OpenAI Playground

Tools: Python, Java, Go, Streamlit and OpenAI Playground
